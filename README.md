# XMPPHTML5JS
This proyect is focused to implement on all web browsers an interface to XMPP stack and servers.
This is pure JS, and we try to avoid as much as possible overcode on the 
base JS like jquery  or others.
For now many XMMP protocols have been already implemented, others 
protocols only works for Firefox and Chrome ( like video conference ) .

For more info about XMMP stack check http://www.xmmp.org

To test the last version of this JS running on a site, test

To collaborate, please download the .JS file and work on it, and come back 
with your upgrades or suggestions.
